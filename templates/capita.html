    <h2 class="two-title">Dam Capacity Per Capita</h2>
    <p><strong>Definition: </strong> The water storage capacity from dams for each person.</p>
    <p>Dam capacity per capita in %%YEAR%% is %%DAM_VALUE%% %%DAM_UNIT%%</p>

    <h2 class="two-title">Dependency Ratio</h2>
    <p><strong>Definition: </strong> Indicator expressing the percent of total renewable water resources originating outside the country. This indicator may theoretically vary between 0% and 100%. A country with a dependency ratio equal to 0% does not receive any water from neighbouring countries. A country with a dependency ratio equal to 100% receives all its renewable water from upstream countries, without producing any of its own. This indicator does not consider the possible allocation of water to downstream countries.</p>
    <p>Dependency ratio in %%YEAR%% is %%DEPENDRATIO_VALUE%% %%DEPENDRATIO_UNIT%%</p>

    <h2 class="two-title">Total Renewable Water Resources Per Capita</h2>
    <p><strong>Definition: </strong> Total annual renewable water resources per inhabitant.</p>
    <p>Renewable water resources per capita in %%YEAR%% is %%WATER_CAPITA_VALUE%% %%WATER_CAPITA_UNIT%%</p>
